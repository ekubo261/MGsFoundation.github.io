## Task: Payment Gateway Interface for a Donation Website
## Technology Used: Html, Css, Bootstrap
This a donation website created as a project for The Sparks Foundation Internship program of January 2023 batch. Here I have integrated Razorpay as a payment gateway interface. This then generates a receipt in pdf format that's sent to the user's email.
